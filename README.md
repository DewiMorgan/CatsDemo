# CatsDemo

My cat Linus died in 2020.

I decided that I would like to mod him and his brother Pixel into as many games as possible, so that I could see them playing together again, and so that I could interact with Linus again. It's a slow process to this goal, and may never even be finished. But it's a hobby, and there's a possibility it may help others grieving for their pets, especially if I could find a good way to texture animals from previously-recorded pictures/video.

This is the base "demo game" of the cats, demoing stuff that could be modded into other games.

For now, basic WASD, animations, etc.

Future possibilities:
 make the cats move around.
- add terrain for the cats to move over, swim in, jump over, etc.
- add interaction with the cats (petting, attacking, picking up?)
- add interaction between cats.
- play as a cat?
